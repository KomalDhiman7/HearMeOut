# HearMeOut

**HearMeOut** is a communication tool built for people who need alternate ways to express themselves - whether through text or visual gestures. It converts text input to speech, and also translates camera gestures into spoken words in real-time.

Designed with accessibility in mind, this app is perfect for non-verbal individuals, people with speech disabilities, or anyone who needs fast, context-aware communication on the go.
